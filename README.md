Video Recommendations, Content Moderation and Ad Targeting. 


The YouTube Project focuses on enhancing user experience and platform integrity through three main components: Video Recommendations, Content Moderation, and Ad Targeting.

Video Recommendations aim to increase engagement by suggesting relevant videos based on users' viewing habits, preferences, and interests.

Content Moderation ensures a safe platform by using algorithms and human reviewers to filter out inappropriate, harmful, or policy-violating content.

Ad Targeting maximizes ad relevance by displaying ads tailored to usersâ€™ interests and demographics, optimizing revenue for the platform and content creators.

Together, these elements work to create a more engaging, safe, and profitable ecosystem on YouTube.
